# Description:
This project is a small, interactive quiz featuring a few JavaScript-related questions. The user is presented with an introduction to the quiz and may press start to begin the quiz.

Once the quiz starts, the user is presented with the first question and a timer is started. Upon answering the question, they move onto the next one, and if they were incorrect the timer subtracts 10 seconds.

Upon finishing all of the questions or running out of time, they are presented with an end screen which will give them a score based on their remaining time. If the user wishes they may type their initials and save their highscore locally (Only one score can be saved at the moment, looking to fix this by submission but if not this message will stay)

Their score can then be veiwed next to their initials on a seperate highscore page. The highscore will persist even when the page is reloaded or opened at an entirely different time. If the user wished they may clear their highscore list.

Current setup did not seem to allow for implementation of audio/I couldn't figure it out so audio is not present
